Hello! I'm Tyler  and welcome to the graduate compiler design course! 

In this class you will learn about advanced topics in compiler design and implementation. In the abstract, compilers explore many of the [foundational problems in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). In practice, compilers are [massive pieces of well-oiled software](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTg3OTQ), and are some of the engineering marvels of the modern world. Given the end of Dennard's scaling, compilers will play an increasingly important role to achieve further computational gains. _The main focus of this class is how compilers can make your code more efficient and safe on modern (and near-future) processors_.

_Special Note for Fall 2021_: The world is still in the midst of a global pandemic. Everyone has had different experiences over the last year and it has been difficult for everyone in different ways. As we return to campus, there will be new difficulties and new challenges. We will work together to solve them and we will have a productive and engaging quarter. That said, this class is designed to be _in person_, please see the COVID policy in the [overview](overview.html) and email me if you have any questions or comments. 

Please take care of yourself; support each other; find time for the things you enjoy. Please email me if you don't feel like you are performing at the best of your ability and we can discuss various accomodations.
